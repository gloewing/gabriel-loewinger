I am a 5th year PhD candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard School of Public Health and am advised by Dr. Giovanni Parmigiani. I conduct statistics and machine learning research with a focus on developing methodologies for training predictive models when multiple training datasets are available (i.e., domain generalization and multi-source domain adaptation). My work leverages tools from mixed integer programming and convex optimization.
