I grew up in Washington, DC and studied neuroscience at Pitzer College in Claremont, CA. I spent my summers during college conducting neuroscience research in labs at UCLA and the University of Maryland Medical School. During my junior year, I studied abroad in Nepal.

After graduating from college, I was fortunate to receive a {{< staticref "https://watson.foundation/fellowships/tj" "newtab" >}}Watson Fellowship{{< /staticref >}} to conduct research for one year in Peru, Brazil, Thailand and Vietnam. I subsequently spent a year in Nepal on a research {{< staticref "https://us.fulbrightonline.org/" "newtab" >}}Fulbright Fellowship{{< /staticref >}}.

After returning from abroad, I received an NIH IRTA research fellowship at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in the laboratory of {{< staticref "https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/research/division-intramural-clinical-and-biological-research/laboratory-integrative-neuroscience" "newtab" >}}Dr. David Lovinger{{< /staticref >}}. At the NIH I witnessed how biomedical sciences increasingly rely on and benefit from statistical methods research. This experience motivated me to pursue graduate training in biostatistics and so I began to take night classes to prepare for doctoral training in this area.

My graduate research has been focused on developing machine learning algorithms that borrow information across different datasets to improve model generalizability. In addition to my advisor,  {{< staticref "https://scholar.harvard.edu/parmigiani" "newtab" >}}Dr. Giovanni Parmigiani{{< /staticref >}}, I collaborate with  {{< staticref "http://www.mit.edu/~rahulmaz/" "newtab" >}}Dr. Rahul Mazumder{{< /staticref >}} at MIT and {{< staticref "https://scholar.harvard.edu/rajarshi/home" "newtab" >}}Dr. Rajarshi Mukherjee{{< /staticref >}} at Harvard. 

Besides my doctoral work, I actively engage in collaborative statistical work with neuroscientists and public health researchers. In addition to applied statistical projects, I also have a few active side research projects developing statistical methods for neuroscience techniques.

In my free time, I like to train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and other forms of grappling. I also love chess, traveling and studying languages.
