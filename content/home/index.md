I grew up in Washington, DC and studied neuroscience at Pitzer College (part of the Claremont Colleges) outside LA. I spent my summers during college doing neuroscience research in labs at UCLA and the University of Maryland Medical School. I studied abroad in Nepal and subsequently spent a year there on a research {{< staticref "https://us.fulbrightonline.org/" "newtab" >}}Fulbright Fellowship{{< /staticref >}} after graduating from college. I also was fortunate to receive and conduct a {{< staticref "https://watson.foundation/fellowships/tj" "newtab" >}}Watson Fellowship{{< /staticref >}} to travel for one year to Peru, Brazil, Thailand and Vietnam studying international treatments for chemical dependence.

After returning from living abroad, I spent a few years as an IRTA research fellow at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, NIH in laboratory of {{< staticref "https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/research/division-intramural-clinical-and-biological-research/laboratory-integrative-neuroscience" "newtab" >}}Dr. David Lovinger{{< /staticref >}}. During my time at the NIH, I witnessed how biomedical sciences increasingly rely on and benefit from statistical methods research. This experience motivated me to pursue graduate training in biostatistics and so I began to take night classes to prepare to pursue doctoral training in this area.

During graduate school I have focused on developing machine learning algorithms that borrow information across different datasets to improve model generalizability. In addition to my advisor,  {{< staticref "https://scholar.harvard.edu/parmigiani" "newtab" >}}Dr. Giovanni Parmigiani{{< /staticref >}}, I collaborate with  {{< staticref "http://www.mit.edu/~rahulmaz/" "newtab" >}}Dr. Rahul Mazumder{{< /staticref >}} at MIT and {{< staticref "https://scholar.harvard.edu/rajarshi/home" "newtab" >}}Dr. Rajarshi Mukherjee{{< /staticref >}} at Harvard. 

Besides my doctoral work, I still actively engage in collaborative statistical work with neuroscientists and public health researchers. In addition to applied statistical work, I also have a few active side research projects developing statistical methods for neuroscience techniques.

In my free time, I like to train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and other forms of grappling. I am very interested in meditation. I also love to travel and study languages.
