Gabe Loewinger is a 5th year doctoral candidate in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard School of Public Health. He is advised by Dr. Giovanni Parmigiani. He conducts statistics and machine learning research with a focus on developing methodologies for training predictive models when multiple training data sets are available (i.e., domain generalization and multi-source domain adaptation). His work leverages tools from mixed integer programming and convex optimization. Please feel free to reach out to me at gloewinger@g.harvard.edu.
