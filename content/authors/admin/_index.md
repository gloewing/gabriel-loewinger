I am a machine learning research scientist at the NIMH where I develop statistical and machine learning methods. I recently completed my PhD in the {{< staticref "https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/" "newtab" >}}Department of Biostatistics{{< /staticref >}} at {{< staticref "https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/" "newtab" >}}Harvard{{< /staticref >}} where I Was an NIH Graduate Fellowship recipient (NRSA: F31). I was advised by {{< staticref "https://scholar.harvard.edu/parmigiani" "newtab" >}}Dr. Giovanni Parmigiani{{< /staticref >}} and conducted statistics and machine learning research with a focus on the development of transfer learning methodologies for training predictive models when multiple training datasets are available (i.e., domain generalization and multi-source domain adaptation). My work leverages tools from mixed integer and convex optimization. My subject area interests include neuroscience and chemical dependence. Please feel free to reach out to me at gloewinger@g.harvard.edu.
