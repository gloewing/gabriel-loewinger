I am a machine learning research scientist at the NIMH where I develop statistical and machine learning methods. I completed my PhD in the {{< staticref "https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/" "newtab" >}}Department of Biostatistics{{< /staticref >}} at {{< staticref "https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/" "newtab" >}}Harvard{{< /staticref >}} where I was an NIH Graduate Fellowship recipient (NRSA: F31). I was advised by {{< staticref "https://scholar.harvard.edu/parmigiani" "newtab" >}}Dr. Giovanni Parmigiani{{< /staticref >}} and conducted statistics and machine learning research with a focus on the development of transfer learning methodologies for training predictive models when multiple training datasets are available (i.e., domain generalization and multi-source domain adaptation). I also collaborated closely with {{< staticref "http://www.mit.edu/~rahulmaz/" "newtab" >}}Dr. Rahul Mazumder{{< /staticref >}} at MIT. My graduate methods research involved tools from mixed integer and convex optimization. At the NIH I have worked on functional data analysis and causal inference methods. My subject area interests include neuroscience and chemical dependence. Please feel free to reach out to me at gloewinger@gmail.com. This site represents my opinions, not my employer's.
